			<h1>IF THESE TREES COULD TALK</h1>
			<h2>What do they have to say?</h2>
			<p>Personally I don't like changes. I like doing the same thing over and over again. Just because I like it. Maybe <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">change</span> is a really important thing for you but not for me, especially in songs that I listen to. I like listening the same thing over and over again. Maybe the reason behind this is that I like instrumental music. I feel different every time I listen to, like it is a deeper level, another chapter, another page...</p>

			<p>I met this group back in March 2015 with the song &quot;Barren Lands Of the Modern Dinosaur&quot;. I added it to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/fatihaltinpinar/playlist/1OwU6Kd1IypR8WcjSxe50k?si=i1naHw9nSFi9ZutMe48kPw">my Spotify playlist</a> then left it there for a while. I was listening to random things back then. Let&#39;s say I did not have a music taste. :)</p>
