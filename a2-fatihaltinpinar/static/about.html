					<h3>Info</h3>
					<p>
						If These Trees Could Talk is extended play (EP) that was released independently on September 27, 2006 at NEMeadow Studios in Bath. Then it was mastered by John Walsh at Lava Room Recordings in Cleveland. It is called EP because it does not contain enough songs to be an album.
					</p>	
					<p>
						These are the songs that I least listened to. I guess the reason behind this is that I added these songs to my playlist after the others. So while I was smashing the replay button above, these songs didn&#39;t get much chance.

						I really don&#39;t want to favor an album to another, since I love listening to all of them. But this album has 3 songs that I really like listening to;From Roots to Needles, Below the Sky and Thirty-Six Silos. It kinda makes it special for me.

						This is the place where all began. Since songs here are long and builds up slowly, this album is my favourite for long bus rides to my homeland. They speak with knives is a great example for that.
