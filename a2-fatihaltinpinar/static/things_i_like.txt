I met this group back in March 2015 with the song "Barren Lands Of the Modern Dinosaur". I added it to my Spotify playlist then left it there for a while. I was listening to random things back then. Let's say I did not have a music taste. :)



If These Trees Could Talk is an instrumental post-rock band from Akron, Ohio. The band self-released their self-titled debut EP in 2006.
